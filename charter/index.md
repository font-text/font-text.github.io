## Goals

The Font and Text community group gathers individuals and organizations
interested in discussing and developing specifications and implementations
for technologies
which operate on and at the interface between
text encoding and font formats.
Examples of such technologies are
shaping engines and text layout applications.

## Scope of work

Under the present charter, the Community Group will
determine a structure and process
under which such specifications may be created
by which the greatest number of interested parties may be able to participate.
Until such a structure and process is determined,
no technical development of specifications or implementations
will be undertaken by this Community Group
and no technical contributions will be accepted.

## Deliverables

No technical specifications will be produced by this Community Group
and no technical contributions are
to be solicited
or accepted.

* This Community Group aims to produce a proposed Charter,
to be used to set up a technical group,
possibly a W3C Working Group,
under which members of this community should conduct technical work.

* If, after producing such a charter,
the Community Group determines that its current composition is adequate
for conducting its work,
then the charter produced is
to be adopted as an updated Charter for this CG.

* If the Community Group determines that it would be appropriate
to divide the technical work into several venues,
it may produce several such proposed charters
rather than a single one.

* Various supporting documents and articles
describing the problem space
may also be produced.

All deliverables of this Community Group will use the
[W3C Software and Document License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document).

This group maintains an [index](https://w3c.github.io/font-text-cg/work-items/)
of the documents it is working on.

## Community and Business Group Process and Patent Policy

The group operates under the [Community and Business Group Process](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/).
Terms of in this charter that conflict with those of the Community and Business Group Process are void.

As with other Community Groups,
W3C seeks organizational licensing commitments
under the [W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/).
(Technical Proposals in this Community Group charter are applicable “Specification” in the CLA).
When people request to participate
without representing their organization’s legal interests,
W3C will in general approve those requests for this group
with the following understanding:
W3C will seek and expect an organizational commitment
under the CLA starting with the individual’s first request
to make a contribution to a group deliverable.
The section on Contribution Mechanics describes
how W3C expects to monitor these contribution requests.

## Communication

This group operates under the
[W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).

This group will conduct its work publicly,
primarily using the public-font-text@w3.org mailing list
([archives](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-font-text/))
for minutes and announcements,
and [GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/font-text-cg)
for discussions
(See [Contribution Mechanics](#contribution-mechanics)).)

Teleconferences and face-to-face meetings
may be held from time to time,
provided sufficient advance notice is given.
Minutes of any such meeting will be
posted to the group’s public mailing list
in a timely manner,
and will include
a transcript of the meeting
to the best of the minute-taker's ability,
together with a list of any
decisions and action items resolved within the meeting
(See [Decision Policy](#decision-policy)).

Deliverables and supporting documents
produced by this Community Group are
hosted on the group’s [GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/font-text-cg).

The group uses the private internal-font-text@w3.org mailing list ([archives](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/internal-font-text/))
for administrative purposes,
such as organizing meetings,
requesting commit access to GitHub,
etc.

Additionally, the group will use
the #font-text channel on the [W3C IRC server](https://www.w3.org/Project/IRC/)
during meetings
and for day-to-day casual chatting.

## Decision Policy

This group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus,
and favors proposals that create the weakest objections.
This is preferred over proposals that are supported by a large majority
but that cause strong objections from a few people.

In some cases,
even after careful consideration of all points of view,
the group might find itself unable to reach consensus.
The Chair(s) may record a decision where there is dissent,
while minuting objections,
so that the group can make progress.
Dissenters cannot stop a group’s work
simply by saying that they cannot live with a decision.
When the Chair(s) believe that the Group has
duly considered the legitimate concerns of dissenters
as far as is possible and reasonable,
the group should move on.

In addition to decisions made
on teleconferences or face to face meetings,
decisions may also be made by a call for consensus
on the public mailing list;
consensus to be determined by the Chair(s)
after some reasonable interval for objections.

All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved
unless and until new information becomes available
or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chair(s).

The Chair(s) may appoint individuals to be the
Editors of the Community Group's Deliverables.
Such Editors are bound by the consensus of the Community Group
as determined by the Chair(s),
and being an Editor does not imply any independent authority
over the content of the deliverable.
Editors may nonetheless be allowed by the Chair(s)
to make non controversial edits
even in the absence of an explicit group decision,
or in order to propose some text to be reviewed by the Community Group.
Even then, if questions or disagreements arise,
the final determination of consensus remains with the Chair(s).

## Contribution Mechanics

Community Group participants agree to make contributions
in the GitHub repo
for the project that they are interested in.
This may be done by submitting a pull request,
by raising an issue,
or by adding a comment to an existing issue.
The Community Group mailing list must not be used
for discussing details of specific projects.

Documents maintained by the Community Group
must use the W3C Software and Document License.

All GitHub repositories attached to the Community Group
must contain a copy of the CONTRIBUTING and LICENSE files.

## Chair Selection

Participants in this group choose their Chair(s)
and can replace their Chair(s)
at any time using whatever means they prefer.

However, if 5 participants
—no two from the same organization—
call for an election,
the group must use the following process
to replace any current Chair(s) with a new Chair,
consulting the Community Development Lead
on election operations (e.g., voting infrastructure and using [RFC 2777](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2777)).

1. **Participants announce their candidacies**.
Participants have 14 days to announce their candidacies,
but this period ends as soon as all participants
have announced their intentions.
If there is only one candidate,
that person becomes the Chair.
If there are two or more candidates,
there is a vote.
Otherwise, nothing changes.
2. **Participants vote**.
Participants have 21 days to vote for a single candidate,
but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted.
The individual who receives the most votes
—no two from the same organization—
is elected chair.
In case of a tie,
[RFC 2777](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2777) is used to break the tie.
An elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.

Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election
may ask the Community Development Lead to intervene.
The Community Development Lead,
after evaluating the election,
may take any action including no action.

## Amendments to this Charter

This Charter can be amended by the Chair(s)
with consultation of the Community Group,
if the change is agreed to by W3C’s Community Development Lead
(Community Development Lead is described in the CG Process).
